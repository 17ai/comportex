# Comportex

Functionally composable cortex, an implementation of Hierarchical
Temporal Memory as a Clojure library.

This is highly experimental. Not even remotely stable. My aims are to:

1. understand the theory deeply by implementing it and playing with it;
2. help others to understand the theory via interactive visual demonstrations; and
3. further develop the theory by attempting to apply it to new problem types.


## Documentation

See the [annotated source code](http://floybix.github.io/comportex/)
for an overview of the data structures, as well as the algorithm in
namespaces `pooling` and `sequence-memory`.


## Usage

Get [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) first.

Use git to clone this repository. Then:

```
lein test
```

The main API is in the namespace `org.nfrac.comportex.core`.
