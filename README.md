Functionally composable cortex, an implementation of Hierarchical
Temporal Memory as a Clojure library.

Comportex is not yet stable. Our aims are to:

1. understand the theory deeply by implementing it and playing with it;
2. help others to understand the theory via interactive visual demonstrations; and
3. further develop the theory by attempting to apply it to new problem types.


## Documentation

See the [annotated source code](http://nupic-community.github.io/comportex/).

The main API is in the namespace `org.nfrac.comportex.core` and in
`org.nfrac.comportex.protocols`.


## Usage

Get [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) first.

Use git to clone this repository. Then, e.g. to start an interactive session:

```
lein repl
```

See [A sample workflow with the
REPL](https://github.com/nupic-community/comportex/wiki/A-sample-workflow-with-the-REPL).

For examples look in `src/cljx/org/nfrac/comportex/demos/` and note
that they can be visualised in the browser with
[ComportexViz](http://github.com/nupic-community/comportexviz/).
