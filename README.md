# comportex

Functionally composable cortex, an implementation of Hierarchical
Temporal Memory as a Clojure library.

This is highly experimental. Not even remotely stable. My aims are to:

1. deeply understand the theory by implementing it and playing with it;
2. help others to understand the theory via interactive visual demonstrations; and
3. further develop the theory by attempting to apply it to new problem types.

Try [Clortex](https://github.com/fergalbyrne/clortex) for a more
complete and usable system.
