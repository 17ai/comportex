# Comportex

Functionally composable cortex, an implementation of Hierarchical
Temporal Memory as a Clojure library.

Comportex is not yet stable. Our aims are to:

1. understand the theory deeply by implementing it and experimenting with it;
2. help others to understand the theory via interactive visual demonstrations; and
3. further develop the theory by attempting to apply it to new problem types.


## Documentation

For now there is the
[annotated source code](http://nupic-community.github.com/comportex/docs/).
The main API is in the namespaces `core` and `protocols`, while the
algorithms are mainly in `cells`, `synapses` and `inhibition`.

Parameter descriptions can be found on [`org.nfrac.comportex.cells/parameter-defaults`](https://github.com/nupic-community/comportex/blob/master/src/org/nfrac/comportex/cells.cljc#L31).

[This blog post](http://floybix.github.io/2014/11/05/htm-protocols/)
has some explanation of the protocols.


## Usage

Get [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) first.

Use git to clone this repository. Then, e.g. to start an interactive session:

```
cd comportex
lein repl
```

See [A sample workflow with the
REPL](https://github.com/nupic-community/comportex/wiki/A-sample-workflow-with-the-REPL).
Or check out the Notebook (browser-based REPL with super powers) in
[ComportexViz](http://github.com/nupic-community/comportexviz/).
